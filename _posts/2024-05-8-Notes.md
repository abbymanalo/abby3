## Finite State Machines
For Platform issues in the Platformer3x game, our team had to utilize state collision so fix the bug with the player when it's on the platform 
``` js
    handlePlayerReaction() {
        // gravity on is default for player/character
        this.gravityEnabled = true;

        // handle player reaction based on collision type
        switch (this.state.collision) {
            // 1. Player is on a jump platform
            case "jumpPlatform":
                // Player is on top of wall
                if (this.collisionData.touchPoints.this.onTopofOther) {
                    this.state.movement = { up: false, down: false, left: true, right: true, falling: false};
                    this.gravityEnabled = false;

                // Player is touching the wall with right side
                } else if (this.collisionData.touchPoints.this.right) {
                    this.state.movement = { up: false, down: false, left: true, right: false, falling: false};
                    this.y -= 4;
                
                // Player is touching the wall with left side
                } else if (this.collisionData.touchPoints.this.left) {
                    this.state.movement = { up: false, down: false, left: false, right: true, falling: false};
                    this.y -= 4;
                }
                break;
               
            // 2. Player is on or touching a wall 
            case "wall":
                // Player is on top of the wall
                if (this.collisionData.touchPoints.this.top && this.collisionData.touchPoints.other.bottom) {
                    this.state.movement = { up: false, down: false, left: true, right: true, falling: false};
                    this.gravityEnabled = false;
                // Player is touching the wall with right side
                } else if (this.collisionData.touchPoints.this.right) {
                    this.state.movement = { up: false, down: false, left: true, right: false, falling: false};
                // Player is touching the wall with left side
                } else if (this.collisionData.touchPoints.this.left) {
                    this.state.movement = { up: false, down: false, left: false, right: true, falling: false};
                }
                break;
```
Something new from this code is the case "wall," which we created so that the player would not run through the sides of the platform too

##  Single Responsibility Principle
As we progress in making our team level, we have to change our dementor enemy since it originally follows the FlyingGoomba code but with a dementor image. This doesn't really work since we're not using a FlyingGoomba for our level so we shouldn't have that reflected in our code. When creating the Dementor.js based off of of FlyingGoomba, I see that it exemplifies the SRP. 
``` js
update() {
        super.update();

        if (this.x <= this.minPosition || (this.x + this.canvasWidth >= this.maxPosition) || this.x > (GameEnv.innerWidth - 100) ) {
            this.speed = -this.speed;
        }

        if (this.speed < 0) {
            this.canvas.style.transform = 'scaleX(1)';
        } else {
            this.canvas.style.transform = 'scaleX(-1)';
        }
```
I believe that it resembles the character update:
``` js
update() {
    // Update the y position of the character based on gravity
    this.updateY();
    // Update animation frameX of the object
    this.updateFrameX(); 
    // Check for collisions, defined in GameObject which calls the collisionAction method
    this.collisionChecks();
}
```
except in the FlyingGoomba example, it's updating the speed and scale of the x positioning in the game
